You've been trolled, you've been trolled Yes, you've probably been told Don't reply to this guy He's just trying to get a rise Out of you, yes, it's true You respond and that's his cue To start trouble on the double While he kills for the trouble You've been trolled, you've been trolled You should probably just fold When the only winning move is not to play And yet you keep on trying, mindlessly replying You've been trolled, you've been trolled, have a nice day
